## NetCDF <a id="netcdf"></a>

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables), including satellite observations such as sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration, and wind speed. 

Many organizations and scientific groups in different countries have adopted netCDF as a standard way to represent scientific data.

The NetCDF format has many advantages, the most important of which is that it is self-describing, meaning that software packages can directly read the data and determine its structure, the variable names and essential metadata such as the units. 
This means that the information needed to ensure accurate work (reduce the incidence of errors) is available within the data itself (no need for additional files). Secondly, it means that different analysis software, like Matlab, R, Python or ArcGIS (among many others), have utilities to read and work with NetCDF files. Thirdly, plotting software (e.g. Ferret, Panoply, ncview) can directly read the netCDF files for visualization.

## Tutorial 2. Make a Map of Global SST <a id="example-2"></a>

Download a global Sea Surface Temperature dataset from CoastWatch and create a map. This is a blended satellite data product which means it has data from multiple satellites. 

1. In a browser, go to the HTTPS server for the dataset and download any file: 

    [https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/pub/socd2/coastwatch/sst_blended/sst5km/night/ghrsst/2022/](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/pub/socd2/coastwatch/sst_blended/sst5km/night/ghrsst/2022/)

2. Open the file in Panoply and view the metadata. Scroll down the metadata list. You can see it looks different from the metadata in the previous example.

3. Identify the names of the instruments and satellites the data come from 

4. How many satellites were used to create this gap-free SST dataset?  

5. Following the same steps as the previous example, create an image of the 
**analysed_sst** variable with an appropriate color scale. (You do not need to use a log scale for SST).

    * Change the **Units** to ºC or ºF  
    
    * Click on **Fit to Data** or adjust the range values manually  
    
    * Adjust the Label Title with the file’s date  
    
    * Uncheck the **Show data min-max** box under `Window > Labels > Footnotes: center`  
    
    * Save the image to your computer

## Tutorial 5. Vector Plots <a id="example-5"></a>

*Adapted by M. Abecassis from: http://davidburchnavigation.blogspot.com/2020/01/viewing-netcdf-weather-files-in-panoply.html*

Look at wind data and create a plot with a color map for wind speed values and arrows for wind direction. 

<br>

**1. Download netCDF wind data**  
    
  * The following link will download a 45MB netCDF file 
    
    https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/files/hawaii2020/CCMP_RT_Wind_Analysis_20210122_V02.1_L3.0_RSS.nc
  
<br>

**2. Open the netCDF file in Panoply**  

  You can see there are two main variables: 
  * uwnd- the east-west component of the wind speed vectors
  * vwnd - the north-south component  
   
<br> 

**3. Create a Vector Plot**  

 * Double-click on `uwnd` and click **Create** 
    
 * You will get a color map of the East-West component of the wind speed for that day, which by itself, is not very insightful.    
    
  * Go back to the variables list and now click on `vwnd`, then click on **Combine Plot**

  * When prompted to choose which plot to combine with, select uwnd and click on **combine**. 
  
<br>

![](./panoply_vectors_combine_plot.png)

<br><br>

  * You will now have two data arrays in the same window, but you need to generate the vectors.
  
  * From the Panoply menu bar, click on **Window** and select **Arrays**
  
  * Click on the drop down menu that says "Array 1 - Array 2" and select `Vector Magnitude`. 
  
  * You now have a vector plot!  
  
  <br>

  ![](./panoply_vectors_plot.png)  

  <br>  
  
**4. Customize Your Plot**  

  * Edit the color scale (select "fit to data" then adjust if needed) 
  
  * Change the units to knots if you wish
  
  * Change the value of wind speed that each arrow represents to a nice round value like 20 for example
  
  * Change the projection
  
  * Edit the title 
  
  <br>
